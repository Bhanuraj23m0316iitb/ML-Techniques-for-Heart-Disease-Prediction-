# Problem Statement
1. Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. Diseases under the heart disease umbrella include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease, heart rhythm problems (arrhythmia), and heart defects youâ€™re born with (congenital heart defects), among others. Prediction of cardiovascular disease is regarded as one of the most important subjects in the section of clinical data science. The amount of data in the healthcare industry is huge.

2. Using machine learning algorithms for heart disease prediction improves accuracy of prediction by exploiting complex interactions between various existing risk factors. The aim of this project is to compare different machine learning models for early prediction of heart diseases
